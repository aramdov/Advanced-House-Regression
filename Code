# Data exploration in explanatory variables & relationships with dependent variable(saleprice)

    # 2 outliers in bottom right when we plot this relationship, best to remove them to avoid it pulling regression line. Be careful however, outliers could contain critical information
    # regarding the data, best to look into those 2 samples and see what's going on before impulsively removing them.
    
sns.boxplot(x='FullBath', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # somewhat positive linearity between # baths & price in the range of 1-3 bathrooms
sns.boxplot(x='TotRmsAbvGrd', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # weak positive linearity between bedrooms & price. It only seems significant increase in price from increase in number of rooms
# in the range of 7-9 rooms.

sns.catplot(x='BedroomAbvGr', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # weak positive linearity, possible check effects with higher sqft houses? (Interaction term differences)
sns.catplot(x='YearBuilt', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # weak positive linearity, check interaction terms with other variables. Decently important variable in real world for house
# pricing, of course other matters about the house can change significance but generally newer houses are correlated with higher prices, whether this relationship is linear is hard to tell.

sns.catplot(x='Condition1', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # weak linearity
sns.boxplot(x='OverallQual', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # decent positive linearity, however i'm suspicious about how this metric was measured, could be suspect to measurement error 
# and make our coefficient estimates biased.

sns.catplot(x='OverallCond', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # week/no linearity between values 5-10
sns.relplot(x='TotalBsmtSF', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # strong positive linearity but this is a surprise to me, why is basement square footage so important?
# I suspect this is a characteristic of Iowa or in general areas similar to Iowa where houses have basements, this is where domain knowledge kicks in and suggests further research.
# I also see an outlier in the bottom right, house with 6000 basement sf but ~ 200k? Have to look into this sample

sns.relplot(x='PoolArea', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # pools are important features in housing price usually, however it seems like very few people own a pool in Iowa therefore we
# wont incorporate a dummy variable about whether a house has a pool or not. Econometric literature usually incorporates pools into their housing price models however, of course domain
# matters as well, not all regions of homes are equal, (ie west coast and east coast)

sns.relplot(x='1stFlrSF', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # strong positive linearity
sns.relplot(x='2ndFlrSF', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # positive linearity, however there are many houses that don't have a 2nd floor, should we turn this into a dummy variable?

sns.boxplot(x='BedroomAbvGr', y='SalePrice', data=home_data) # no correlation between bedrooms and price

# Visualizing how neighborhood categories are associated with price to address categorical variable encoding issue
# 1 method is to group the neighborhoods by 2 categories, rich and poor, for this I try to see if there significant differences in price across neighborhoods
# Visually I don't see much evidence for this so I don't thinks this method of encoding would be useful.
